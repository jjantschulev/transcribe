# transcribe app.

## Run the app:

1. run `git clone`
2. `cd transcribe`
3. `yarn install` (or just `yarn`)
4. run `yarn start` to start the react dev server.
5. while that is running, run `yarn electron` to start the electron app.

_I'm still working on adding a production mode where the app will run from a built react app (not the dev server)_
